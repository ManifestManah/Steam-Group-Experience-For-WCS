# [WC:S Reignited] Steam Group Experience System

## About
By adding this plugin to your server, all players that are member of your steam group will receive 5 additional experience for every kill they make, and an additional 20 experience every time a new round starts.
In order for players to gain experience for being a member of your steam group, you will have to change the ID to match your steam group's ID. This can be done in the autogenerated configuration file mentioned in the installation section.
